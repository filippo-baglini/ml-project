# ML-Project

## Description
This project involves the implementation of a feedforward neural network from scratch, compared to models built using Keras, a well-established library for machine learning. The project is part of the Machine Learning exam for the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence

## Important Instructions
1. **Check Requirements**: Before running any code, ensure you have installed all necessary libraries by referring to the `requirements.txt` file ✅

2. **Testing the Custom Neural Network**:
   - 📂 Access any of the directories inside the `tests` folder
   - ▶️ Run any of the test scripts available in the chosen directory

3. **Performance Expectations**:
   - ⚡ Training a single model using batch training on any of the Monk datasets generally takes less than a second
   - ⏱️ Training a single model on the Cup dataset requires a few seconds

## Oracle Files
- 📁 All oracle models built with Keras are located in the `oracle` folder
- To train a model on an entire dataset, perform k-fold cross-validation or execute a grid search, simply run the corresponding Python file in the `oracle` directory 🖥️

Good luck! 🎉
