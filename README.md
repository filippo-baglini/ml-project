# ML-project

Implementation from scracth of a feedforward neural network with a comparison to models built using keras, a well known and established library for machine learning; project for the exam of Machine Learning from the Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence.

## Important!
Before executing any code check the requirements.txt to ensure you have installed all the needed libraries.

To test the NN built from scratch, access any of the directories inside the directory 'tests' and then run any of the tests present.

Generally to train a single model using batch training on any of the Monk datasets it takes less than a second, whereas training a single model on the Cup dataset requires a few seconds.
